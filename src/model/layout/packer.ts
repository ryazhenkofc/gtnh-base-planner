/**
 * UNIT 1 — Layout packing.
 *
 * Auto-place `count` units of `def` as compactly as possible.
 * - When `def.wallshare`, neighbours overlap by one block (pitch = size - 1) so they share walls;
 *   otherwise they are placed side by side without overlap.
 * - A controller cell must never lie on a shared (overlapping) face: pick rotations so controllers face outward.
 * - At most `limits` units along each world axis (x, y = layers, z; null = unlimited).
 * - Deterministic, pure, and fast (< 20 ms for 60 units).
 * Returns fewer units than requested with a `reason` when they do not fit.
 *
 * How it works: units sit on a lattice (counts nx × ny × nz). Along each axis the spacing is either uniform
 * (shared wall or touching) or "paired": two units back to back, then a one-block walkway that the controllers
 * of neighbouring pairs face. All units share one rotation parity so their rotated bounding boxes are equal;
 * within that parity a unit may be turned by 180° depending on its lattice index along one horizontal axis,
 * which puts rows back to back with controllers facing outward. Every lattice shape is scored analytically
 * (shared faces, height, area) and candidates are validated best-first against memoised pairwise cell
 * checks, so only a handful are ever fully checked.
 */

/**
 * Every valid layout of exactly `count` units within `limits`, best first: the compact layouts `packUnits`
 * chooses from, then looser ones (gaps between units, walkways) that leave more faces open for hatches.
 * Lazy, so callers can stop at the first layout that suits them. Identical layouts are yielded once.
