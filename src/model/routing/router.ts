/**
 * UNIT 4 — Pipe routing.
 *
 * For each routed kind, connect the cells beside all its hatches into one network that never shares a
 * cell with another kind's. Each network is grown from one hatch towards the cheapest unconnected one,
 * where a bend costs `turnCost` extra blocks. Kinds are negotiated (see `MAX_ROUNDS`): networks may first
 * overlap at a price, and contested cells get dearer each round until every kind has its own cells. If
 * the rounds run out, the kinds are routed one after another around the ones already laid, cheapest
 * uncontested cells first.
 * - Pipes never pass through structure cells (including air interiors), another kind's network or the
 *   ground below the build's lowest layer, nor through the cell in front of a controller or of a hatch
 *   that is not routed (mufflers vent there, maintenance needs the player).
 * - The cell in front of each routed hatch's placed face is reserved for its kind; its other open sides
 *   are free for any pipe, and the hatch attaches through whichever side its pipe reaches.
 * - A block off the walls costs `wallCost` more, so pipes follow the build and the ground.
 * - Finished networks are reworked branch by branch (`refineTree`) where a cheaper path joins a hatch.
 * - Search is bounded to the structure bounding box grown by 4 blocks (and to `MAX_GRID_CELLS`).
 * - Reports `connected` / `total` terminals and `length` in pipe blocks.
 * Pure and deterministic. Nets are returned in `ROUTED_KINDS` order.
