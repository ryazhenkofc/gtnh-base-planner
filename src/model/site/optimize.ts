/**
 * Optimises an arranged site in two stages, and keeps whatever the real router likes best.
 *
 * 1. Explore: anneal the groups' places from several seeds on a cheap estimate of pipe length
 *    (`annealGroups`), then route the start layout and the results, best estimate first. The estimate cannot
 *    see hatches or walls, so it is only good for finding candidates: its best layout often routes worse than
 *    the start.
 * 2. Polish: anneal again from the best layout found, this time judging every step by the router itself
 *    (`scoreBuild`, cached per layout), for a number of steps or what is left of the time budget.
 *
 * One time budget covers it all. Routing one layout takes from milliseconds to seconds (a plan of a thousand
 * machines needs several), so the first routing of the start layout sets the pace: fewer candidates are
 * routed and the polish is skipped when it could make only a few steps. The budget is met to within one
 * routing.
 *
 * Groups of several units may also be packed another way (other `limits`: rows, layers; see `groupShapes`), and
 * the result says how many were. Runs alternate between allowing that and keeping every packing: repacking
 * widens the spread of results more than it moves the median, and the best layout wins either way.
 *
 * Ranking, in order: build problems (overlaps, groups outside, ...), terminals left unconnected, pipe and
 * cable blocks, then the width + depth of the layout. The start wins ties, so the result is never worse than
 * the arrangement it was given.
