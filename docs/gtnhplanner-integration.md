# Plan: GTNH Planner integration and multi-machine sites

Status: milestones 1–6 are implemented (see "What was built" at the end). Milestone 7 waits on GTNH Planner.

Goal: take a production chain from [GTNH Planner](https://gtnhplanner.com) (a flowchart of recipes, machine
counts and item/fluid flows), turn every recipe node into a group of our multiblocks, place the groups on a
bounded site (for example 30 × 30 blocks), route pipes between them, and show the inputs and outputs in 3D.

## 1. What GTNH Planner exposes

The site is a Next.js app (`GET /api/version` returns `{"version":"3.9.2"}` as of 2026-09-26). The code is open
source (MIT). It was forked from `Samiracle64/gtnh-factory-flow` and then diverged. The route and schema names
below come from the forks (`src/app/api/**/route.ts` and `src/lib/model/schemas.ts`). We checked the live site
for the endpoints marked "checked".

| Endpoint                                          | Auth | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /api/version`                                | none | Checked.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `GET /api/community/plans`                        | none | Checked. Lists public plans: `id`, `name`, `description`, `gameVersion`, `datasetVersionId`, `tags`, `icon`, `needs[]` and `outputs[]` (`kind`, `resourceId`, `displayName`, `dominantColor`, `ratePerSecond`). |
| `GET /api/community/plans/{id}?countView=0`       | none | One plan's summary. Without `countView=0`, each call counts as a view.                                                                                                                                          |
| `POST /api/community/plans/{id}/download`         | none | Returns the full project JSON (below). Each call counts as a download.                                                                                                                                          |
| `GET /api/datasets/{versionId}/catalog\|recipes…` | none | The recipe dataset. We do not need it for layout.                                                                                                                                                               |
| `/api/blueprints`, `/api/library`                 | user | Checked: both return 401. Out of scope.                                                                                                                                                                         |

**The live API sends no CORS headers.** A request with our site's origin (tested as `https://ryazhenkofc.github.io`) gets no
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, so our static app cannot call it from the browser. Right now the only way in is
the **Export JSON** button on their board (`serializeFactoryProject`), followed by file upload or paste on our
side.

### Their project format (`factoryProjectSchema`, `schemaVersion: 1`)

Only the fields we use are listed.

```ts
recipes[]:  { id, name, machineType, minimumTier, durationTicks, eut,
              inputs[]/outputs[]: { kind: 'item'|'fluid'|'aspect'|'power', id, amount, displayName?, dominantColor? },
              machineHandlers?[]: { id, label, kind?: 'single'|'multiblock'|… }, power?: { sourceId, euPerTick } }
nodes[]:    { id, recipeId, machineCount (fractional), overclockTier, energyHatches?, machineHandlerId?,
              coilTier?, enabled, pocketId?, position }
storages[]: { id, kind, resourceId, displayName?, dominantColor?, drainMode?: 'product'|'byproduct'|'trash' }
edges[]:    { id, source, target (node or storage ids), resourceKind, resourceId, ratePerSecond? }
pockets[]:  { id, name, parentPocketId? }   // their visual sub-groups
```

`machineType` holds display names: `"Blast Furnace"` (alias `"Electric Blast Furnace"`), `"Oil Cracker"`
(alias `"Oil Cracking Unit"`), `"Large Chemical Reactor"`/`"LCR"`, `"Distillation Tower"`, `"Vacuum Freezer"`,
`"Pyrolyse Oven"`, `"Coke Oven"`, `"Multi Smelter"`, `"Implosion Compressor"`, `"TurboCan Pro"`,
`"Industrial Autoclave"`, `"Dissection Apparatus"`, `"Big Barrel Brewery"`, `"Large Fluid Extractor"`,
`"Bricked Blast Furnace"`, and so on. The alias list lives in their `src/lib/machines/machine-table.ts`. Many of
these are already in our catalog. Single-block machines (`"Assembler"`, `"Macerator"`, `"Bender"`,
`"Chemical Reactor"` …) and passive sources (`"Crop Farm"`, `"Bee Produce"`, ore veins, `"Source"`) also appear.

## 2. Mapping their model onto ours

| GTNH Planner                                  | Wall-share planner                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| recipe node                                   | **Group**: `ceil(machineCount)` units of one multiblock, packed with today's packer                       |
| `recipe.machineType` / handler label          | `multiblockId`, through a new table `src/data/gtnhplanner-machines.ts` (name and aliases → id)            |
| `node.energyHatches`, `overclockTier`         | energy hatch count per unit; tier shown in the label                                                      |
| item/fluid `edge`                             | **Link**: output hatch of group A → input hatch of group B, one net per link resource                     |
| `power` edge / `recipe.power` (generators)    | cable link: dynamo → energy (the Cables toggle already routes these)                                      |
| `aspect` edge                                 | dropped, with a notice (Thaumcraft)                                                                       |
| recipe input that no edge feeds               | **site input port** on the site boundary                                                                  |
| output nothing consumes, or a `product` drain | **site output port**                                                                                      |
| `trash` drain                                 | output port with a "void" marker                                                                          |
| `dominantColor`, `displayName`                | colour and name of the resource (pipe colour, legend)                                                     |
| `pocketId`                                    | hint to keep groups together when arranging (optional)                                                    |
| single-block machine                          | new generic `singleblock` def: 1×1×1, I/O on its own faces                                                |
| multiblock we have not transcribed            | placeholder box (size from a small table, else 3×3×3), marked "not transcribed", listed for the extractor |
| passive source (crops, bees, veins)           | site input port                                                                                           |

The import dialog shows this mapping before anything is built. The user sees one row per node with the
proposed multiblock (a dropdown to override it, or "single block" / "skip"), the unit count and its resources.

## 3. New plan model: a site

`PlanState` has one `multiblockId` today. We add a v2 state that is a superset. A v1 plan loads as a site
with one group, so current links and saved plans keep working.

```ts
interface SiteState {
  v: 2;
  site: { size: [w: number, d: number]; maxHeight?: number }; // default [30, 30]
  groups: GroupState[];
  links: LinkState[];
  ports: SitePort[]; // boundary inputs/outputs
  resources: Record<string, { kind: 'item' | 'fluid' | 'power'; name: string; color: string }>;
  colors: Partial<Record<HatchKind, string>>;
}
interface GroupState {
  id: string;
  label?: string;
  multiblockId: string;
  count: number;
  limits: PlanLimits;
  size?: number;
  enabledHatches: HatchKind[];
  origin: [x: number, z: number]; // min corner in the site; y = 0
  rotation: Rotation;
  manualUnits?: Unit[]; // in group-local coordinates
  source?: { gtnhNodeId: string; recipeName: string; machineCount: number };
}
interface LinkState {
  id: string;
  from: { group: string } | { port: string };
  to: { group: string } | { port: string };
  resource: string; // key of `resources`
  rate?: number; // per second, from the edge
}
```

- `codec.ts`: `PLAN_VERSION = 2` with a validator for the new shape; v1 is still decoded and migrated. Only
  the fields above are stored. Recipes, icons and NEI data are dropped, so a 20-group import stays a few KB
  compressed, well under `MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES` (64 KB).
- `store.ts`: `plan` becomes the site. The current single-machine UI edits the selected group.

## 4. Pipeline changes

Today: `plan → packUnits → placeHatches → computeWallStats → routePipes → buildSceneModel`, all for one `def`.

1. **Per group** (memoised by group, so moving one group does not repack the others): the existing
   `resolveLayout` + `placeHatches` in group-local coordinates.
   - **Hatches per resource.** A group needs one output hatch of kind `k` for each distinct output resource of
     that kind, and one input hatch for each input resource. `placeHatches` takes this as a demand that raises
     `requiredHatches[k].min`. Each placed hatch gets a `resource` tag. Shareable hatches are only shared
     inside one group and for the same resource. If the demand is more than the structure's `max`, show a
     warning.
2. **Site transform**: move each group to world space (origin + rotation of its bounding box, reusing
   `rotateLocal`/`toWorld`).
3. **Collisions and bounds**: overlap between groups is an error. Cells outside `site.size` are drawn red. In
   v1, groups do not share walls with other groups (see open questions).
4. **Terminal assignment**: for each link, choose the source and target hatches with its resource. When a
   group has several, pick the one nearest the other end.
5. **Routing, generalised** (then `routing.ts`, now `src/model/routing/`): today there is one net per `HatchKind` and one `def`. Change it to
   one net per link or port net, with explicit terminals and solids from every group.
   - `termMask` is a `Uint8Array` bitmask of 7 kinds. Replace it with a `Uint16Array` net index. `occ` becomes
     `PIPE + netIndex` in a `Uint16Array`.
   - Search box = site box (`w × d × maxHeight`) instead of structure bounds + `MARGIN`.
   - Order: nets with more terminals and longer spans first. If some stay unconnected, rip up and reroute them
     with a congestion penalty (PathFinder style), limited to a few passes.
   - Keep the current bend cost, no-underground rule and rotate-the-hatch-to-the-pipe rule.
   - Budget: 30 × 30 × 16 ≈ 14k cells is small. With about 40 nets it should still take under 100 ms. If it
     does not, move routing into a Web Worker.
6. **Scene**: voxels of all groups, nets coloured by resource, port markers, group labels.

## 5. Arranging groups on the site

- **Auto-arrange (layered)**: build the group graph from links. Reverse the back edges of cycles (recycle
  loops). Assign layers by longest path. Place layers west → east and order groups within a layer by the
  barycenter heuristic (2–3 sweeps) to reduce crossings. Input ports go on the west edge, outputs on the east.
- **Footprints**: each group's bounding box comes from its pack. The arranger may try other `limits` (for
  example 2 rows instead of 1) so a group fits the site depth. Leave a configurable corridor (default 2
  blocks) between groups for pipes.
- **Does not fit**: say so with the size needed ("needs 34 × 30"). Optionally stack low groups.
- **Manual**: drag a group on the ground grid (snap to blocks), `R` rotates it, and collisions are highlighted
  live. Before 3D dragging exists, number fields in Settings do the same job.
- Optimiser (built, OPTIMIZE button): simulated annealing on group positions and turns, cost = estimated wire length
  - bounding-box span, from several seeds; the best layouts are routed and must beat the plain arrangement on the
    router's own numbers (`src/model/site/anneal.ts`, `optimize.ts`). Not yet: changing a group's `limits`, bends in
    the estimate.

## 6. Showing I/O

- Ground grid of the site with boundary lines and coordinates.
- Pipes coloured by resource (`dominantColor`, or a palette colour when it is missing). Item conveyors are
  square, fluid pipes round, cables thin (as today).
- Flow direction: chevrons animated along each path (a UV offset in the shader), with speed on a log scale of
  the rate.
- Hover or click a pipe or hatch to see, for example: "Nitrogen · 250 L/s · EBF ×4 → Vacuum Freezer ×2 · 38
  blocks".
- Group labels above the controller, for example "EBF ×4 (3.4 needed) · HV".
- Site ports: coloured posts on the boundary, plus an I/O panel listing site inputs and outputs with rates
  (the same numbers as their "needs" and "outputs").
- Legend with every resource. Click one to isolate it (everything else dims).
- Warnings: link not routed, hatch demand above the structure's max, group outside the site, machine not
  transcribed.
- Later: pick a GT pipe material from the link rate (fluid pipe capacity tiers).

## 7. How we connect to GTNH Planner

- **A. File or paste (no change needed on their side).** "Import from GTNH Planner" accepts their exported
  JSON. We parse it with our own permissive validator, in the style of `validatePlanState`: no new
  dependency, unknown fields ignored, input capped at about 5 MB. Then the mapping dialog opens, then
  auto-arrange runs. Everything happens in the browser, which keeps the README's privacy promise.
- **B. Browse community plans in the app (needs their cooperation).** This is blocked by CORS. Ask the
  maintainers for:
  - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on `GET /api/community/plans` and `GET /api/community/plans/{id}`
  - a read-only `GET` export, or CORS on the `POST` download

  With that in place, we can also accept a pasted gtnhplanner.com plan link. A proxy of our own (for example
  a Cloudflare Worker) would work too. It is not recommended: it adds a server and breaks the "no server"
  statement in the README.

- **C. "Open in 3D" from their site (optional, needs them).** They link to
  `https://gtnh-wallshare-planner.pages.dev/#gtnh=<planId>`, or pass the JSON through `postMessage`.

B and C send a request to a third party, so they only run on a user action, and we document them in the
README's Privacy section. We do not hotlink their item icons: we use colour swatches.

## 8. Milestones

Each milestone ships on its own, with `npm run check && npm test` green and e2e updated.

1. **Site model**: `SiteState` types, v1 → v2 migration, codec v2, persistence. Tests for round trips and
   migration.
2. **Several groups**: per-group pipeline, world transform, collisions and bounds, scene for several groups,
   site ground grid, a group list in Settings with numeric placement.
3. **Links and routing**: resource-tagged hatch demand in `ports.ts` (now `src/model/hatches/`), net-based routing in `routing.ts` (now
   `src/model/site/router.ts`), site
   ports. Tests: one link between two groups, a loop, a dense 30 × 30 case with a time budget.
4. **I/O display**: resource colours, flow chevrons, tooltips, legend with isolation, labels, I/O panel.
5. **Arranging**: layered auto-arrange, then drag and rotate in 3D.
6. **GTNH Planner import (A)**: parser, machine mapping table and tests, `singleblock` and placeholder defs,
   mapping dialog. The parser and mapping have no UI dependencies, so they can be built and tested next to
   milestones 1–3 against a real exported plan.
7. **Community browse (B/C)**, only if the upstream CORS change happens.

## 9. Open questions

1. Site size: fixed 30 × 30 or configurable (30 × 30 by default)? Is there a height limit?
2. May groups from different nodes share walls? For example, two EBF groups side by side could share casings.
3. Items: GT pipes and conveyors, or ME? Many bases move items over AE2, and then only fluids need pipes. A
   per-site "items via ME" toggle would turn item links into interface markers instead of routes.
4. Is anyone in touch with the GTNH Planner maintainers about CORS or a read-only export?
5. We need one or two real exported plans (their **Export JSON**) to use as test fixtures.

## 10. What was built

Milestones 1–6, with these choices where the plan left a question open or the code suggested another way:

- **A separate site format instead of `PlanState` v2.** The single-machine view, its links (`#p=`) and saved
  plans are untouched. A site is its own state (`src/model/site/types.ts`), validated by
  `src/share/siteCodec.ts`, saved under `gtnh-planner:site:v1` and shared as `#s=`. The top bar switches between
  MACHINE and SITE, and SETTINGS → ADD TO SITE turns the current plan into a group.
- **Site size** is configurable (8–128 per side), 30 × 30 by default, with a corridor setting (default 2). There
  is no height limit; pipes may pass up to 3 blocks above the tallest group.
- **Groups do not share walls with other groups** (overlaps are reported). Groups share walls inside themselves
  as before.
- **Items travel in pipes** like fluids; there is no ME mode yet.
- **Routing** (`src/model/site/router.ts`) is net-based: one net per resource and connected set of links, grown
  as a bend-priced shortest-path tree, then up to four rounds of rip-up and negotiated rerouting (contested
  cells get more expensive). On the test chain every terminal connects in about 120 ms; the rare leftovers are
  listed under PROBLEMS.
- **Moving groups** is done with the arrow keys, R and the X/Z fields rather than by dragging in 3D.
- **Ports** are placed automatically on the west (inputs) and east (outputs) edges, next to the groups they
  serve; the format keeps an optional explicit position for later.
- **Rates** come only from GTNH Planner edges (shown in the link list and the bottom line); they are not
  recomputed from recipes.
- **Icons**: item and fluid icons come from the export's `iconPath` and are loaded from gtnhplanner.com in the
  HTML parts of the site view (they can be switched off). They cannot be drawn in 3D: the site sends no CORS
  headers, and WebGL refuses cross-origin images.
- **Block textures**: the site stand-ins and ports have GT5-Unofficial textures too (hazard-striped placeholder
  casing; Super Chest, Super Tank and energy-output fronts on the ports), as do the Assembly Line casing and the
  solenoid coil, which were flat before.
- The **import fixture** (`src/import/__fixtures__/gtnhplanner-titanium.json`) is hand-written to the schema.
  A real Export JSON should be added as a second fixture.
